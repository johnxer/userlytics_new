                    <p>If you do not want to upgrade to the newest version of Java, there are some workarounds yu can perform by adjusting your configuration settings.</p>
                    <p>The bug induced error in older versions of Java mostly happens when the "Trusted Publishers" option is not enabled in your configuration settings.</p>
                    <p><strong>Userlytics has been verified by Verisign</strong>, and this will be shown to you if you <strong>enable the "Enable list of trusted publishers"</strong> option and <strong>disable the "Enable online certificate validation"</strong> option.</p>

                    <p>In order to do so, please follow the steps below:</p>

                      <li>If you are a <strong>Windows Vista or Windows 7</strong> user: Go to Start Menu > Control Panel > Programs > click on Java (32 bits);<br />
                          If you are a <strong>Windows XP</strong> user: Go to Start Menu > Control Panels > Java</li>
