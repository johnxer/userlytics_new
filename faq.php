                                                <p>Unfortunately there is a <a target="_blank" href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7197652">bug</a> in older versions of Java.</p>
                                                <p>If you do not want to upgrade to the newest version of Java, there are some workarounds yu can perform by adjusting your configuration settings.</p>
                                                <p>The bug induced error in older versions of Java mostly happens when the "Trusted Publishers" option is not enabled in your configuration settings.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Userlytics has been verified by Verisign</strong>, and this will be shown to you if you <strong>enable the "Enable list of trusted publishers"</strong> option and <strong>disable the "Enable online certificate validation"</strong> option.</p>

If you are invited to participate and another member of the panel, also invited, accepts before you do, depending upon the number of available test slots, you may not be able to accept that test and it will be listed as one you "missed". However, sometimes slots for a particular study are reopened because our Quality Assurance verification discovered that the tester did not speak out loud his or her thoughts while conducting the test, so you might have another chance at this particular study later on. And new tests are coming in all the time anyway, so don't worry, you'll get your chance!</p>
